        <p>In Hangman, the goal is to guess the hidden word before the hangman figure is fully drawn. Here are the rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select a letter to guess one at a time.</li>
            <li>If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position(s).</li>
            <li>If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.</li>
            <li>You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.</li>
            <li>The game ends when either:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You correctly guess the entire word.</li>
                <li>The hangman figure is fully drawn, and you lose the round.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You can select difficulty levels that affect the number of incorrect guesses allowed.</li>
            <li>Try to guess the word with as few mistakes as possible for a higher score!</li>
        </ul>
